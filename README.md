| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 6+               | 1-2               |  5 - 15 minutes      | 8 & Up           |

## Objective
Get every side of every Blink connected to matching sides with other Blinks. 

## Setup
### 2-player
Double click to enter setup mode. Verified by blinking bright and darker. One player sets up the board in setup mode and then then double clicks again to set the board. (this shows a quick flash to confirm the setting of the board) Additionally, the flashing bright/dark will stop when in game play mode. separate and mix up the pieces and hand to player two to let them try and solve. 

## Gameplay
Arrange the Blinks to satisfy the objective. 4 pieces should be trivially easy, 6 pieces can be tricky, more than 6 pieces is a mental workout to say the least.
